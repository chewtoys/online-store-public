# Architecture

_Server_

1. Every listView data should come with current user permissions for lw's entity
2. Separate 'Identity' project with redefined entities and stores

_Client_

1. Every listview visualization must be wrapped in common component that supports:

- displaying errors
- limiting menu actions

2. Lazy loading pictures component

# Online store functions

come soon

# If its toooooo boring

1. Check lifistyle's correctness -> emit multiuser's edit same entity
