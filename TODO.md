# Architecture

_Server_

1. Every listView data should come with current user permissions for lw's entity
2. Separate 'Identity' project with redefined entities and stores
3. Make entities with nav property of FileData type return file guid after create

_Client_

4. Every listview visualization must be wrapped in common component that supports:

- displaying errors
- limiting menu actions

2. Lazy loading pictures component

# Online store functions

come soon

# If its toooooo boring

1. Check lifistyle's correctness -> emit multiuser's edit same entity
